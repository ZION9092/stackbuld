## Getting Started

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
- **Firebase Account**: Set up a Firebase project for Firestore integration.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZION9092/stackbuld.git

### Side Note
Integrating firebase wasn't succesful as I've not fully mastered it.
